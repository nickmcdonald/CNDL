description: If you are a professional (Revenue > $2000/year) We ask that you support us financially in a way that you find fair. Below are some suggestions for how you can support us. CNDL is developed by a small, independant team of <strong>1</strong> people with no investors or financial support. Your contribution will go towards the development of CNDL and future projects. Our goal is to develop a suite of niche tools and products like CNDL to increase the productivity of Game Developers and 3D Artists.<br/><br/>You can support us on patreon to get access to our private discord server for developer support.

faq:
  - question: Do I have to pay for CNDL to use it commercially?
    answer: If you are a Professional (Revenue > $2000/year), and you use CNDL as part of your workflow, we strongly request that you support us financially in some way, even if its a small amount.
  - question: What if I don't want to pay right now?
    answer: Don't worry about it. Enjoy the software, make sure it is providing value and remember that you can support us at any time. Also, please consider telling a friend about CNDL to help grow our user base.
  - question: Is CNDL open source?
    answer: Not at the moment, but that may change. CNDL is still early in its development cycle, and it's our first project of this kind. We may open source it eventually when the code is more stable.
  - question: I don't want a patreon subscription, can I support CNDL another way?
    answer: Absolutely, you can donate any amount (recurring or one-time) directly via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=8SFL6DVAVMJ8Q">paypal, or you could purcase the Professional use "DLC" on Steam</a>.
