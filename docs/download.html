faq:
  - question: Do I have to pay for CNDL to use it commercially?
    answer: No. It is totally free to use, for any purpose. Our philosophy is that we should <strong>earn</strong> your money by making a product that you <strong>want to support</strong>
  - question: What if I don't want to pay right now?
    answer: Don't worry about it. Enjoy the software and remember that you can support us at any time. Or consider telling a friend about CNDL to help grow our user base.<br/><a href="https://github.com/nickmcdonald/CNDLDownloads/releases">Click here to download CNDL for free</a>
  - question: Is CNDL open source?
    answer: Not at the moment, but that may change. CNDL is still early in its development cycle, and it's our first project of this kind. We plan to open source it eventually if this business model is effective.
  - question: I don't want a patreon subscription, can I support CNDL another way?
    answer: Absolutely, you can donate any amount directly via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=8SFL6DVAVMJ8Q">paypal</a>.
