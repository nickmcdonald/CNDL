faq:
  - question: Do I have to pay for CNDL to use it commercially?
    answer: If you are making money with CNDL, we would really appreciate your financial support. But its not a requirement. Our philosophy is that we should <strong>earn</strong> your money by making a product that you <strong>want to support</strong>
  - question: What if I don't want to pay right now?
    answer: Don't worry about it. Enjoy the software and remember that you can support us at any time. Or consider telling a friend about CNDL to help grow our user base.
  - question: Is CNDL open source?
    answer: Not at the moment, but that may change. CNDL is still early in its development cycle, and it's our first project of this kind. We plan to open source it eventually when the code is more stable.
  - question: I don't want a patreon subscription, can I support CNDL another way?
    answer: Absolutely, you can donate any amount (recurring or one-time) directly via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=8SFL6DVAVMJ8Q">paypal</a> or by buying the Steam DLC.
